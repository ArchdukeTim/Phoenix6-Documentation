CHRP Converter
==============

CHRP functionality is a feature of compatible TalonFX motors that actuate the rotor at very specific frequencies, creating audible output. This output can be in the form of music.

Tuner offers the ability to convert `MIDI <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI>`__ soundtracks to compatible CHRPs. Simply follow the on-screen instructions and press :guilabel:`Import MIDI`.

.. note:: Information on playing a CHRP in a robot project can be found in :doc:`/docs/api-reference/api-usage/chrp-playback`.
