#. Wheel Radius (inches)

   * The radius can be found by measuring the width of the module wheel, then dividing that by 2.

#. FL to FR distance (inches)

   * This is the distance between the center of the front-left module, and the center of the front-right module.

#. FL to BL distance (inches)

   * This is the distance between the center of the front-left module, and the center of the back-right module.

#. Module Type

   * Whether or not the Swerve X module is flipped, unflipped, or flipped gear. Users not using Swerve X modules should select :guilabel:`Manual` instead.

#. Drive Ratio

   * This is the gearing ratio between the output shaft of the motor and the module wheel. Swerve X users can find that information `here <https://docs.wcproducts.com/frc-build-system/gearboxes/swerve#drive-ratios>`__.

* Steer Ratio (non-WCP Swerve X)

  * This is the gearing ratio between the output shaft of the steering motor and the azimuth gear. Users must calculate this based on their gearing themselves, or consult their manufacture.

6. Open Project

   * Open an existing Tuner swerve project save file.

7. New Project

   * Create a new project based on the settings configured.

Users should configure the settings applicable for their robot and click :guilabel:`New Project` once they are done.
