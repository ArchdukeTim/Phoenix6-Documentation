Season Pass Licensing
=====================

.. tip:: Season Pass can be purchased at `https://store.ctr-electronics.com/ <https://store.ctr-electronics.com/phoenix-pro/>`__.

Season Pass is a single, cost-effective purchase that allows **FRC teams** to license :ref:`compatible devices <docs/licensing/licensing:device licensing>` with Phoenix Pro for the entire season. The steps for licensing devices with season pass are as follows.

1. Purchase a season pass at `https://store.ctr-electronics.com/ <https://store.ctr-electronics.com/phoenix-pro/>`__.
2. Wait for the email that says your license is ready (typically 1-2 minutes).
3. Follow the below steps for attaching a team number to your license.
4. Once a team number has been attached, licensing process is the same as :doc:`/docs/licensing/licensing`.
